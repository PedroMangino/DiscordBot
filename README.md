# DiscordBot
A simple discord bot

--- 
Trying to make a bot that uses an external API to give information to the users

To make the bot work you should create a "config.json" file on the project directory
with the follow properties
{
    "prefix": "$",
    "botToken": "YOUR-DISCORD-BOT-TOKEN",
    "riotKey" : "YOUR-LOL-API-KEY"
}
